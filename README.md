# EmoSupport-A-Comparative-Study-for-the-Analysis-of-Mental-Health-of-Undergraduate-Students

This research project explores the application of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forests, for predicting and assessing stress, anxiety, and depression levels based on survey responses. The project aims to develop robust predictive models capable of discerning and forecasting psychological states, providing insights into the relationship between survey questions and the manifestation of stress-related conditions. Through meticulous data collection, extensive exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering, the research delves deep into understanding the nuances of psychological well-being. The findings contribute to bridging the gap between traditional mental health assessments and contemporary machine learning techniques, laying the foundation for future research and applications aimed at early detection and personalized interventions for stress, anxiety, and depression.
